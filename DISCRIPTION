# doc-qa-app
This project is a Document-based Question Answering System using Streamlit, LangChain, OpenAI GPT-4, and ChromaDB. Users can upload PDF or Word files, which are chunked and embedded into vectors. Queries are matched with relevant content, and GPT-4 generates context-aware answers. Useful for legal, academic, and business domains.
